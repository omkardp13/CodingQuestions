The problem of finding the "k-th smallest element" means identifying the element that ranks as the 𝑘

k-th smallest in a given data structure, such as an array or list. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

What is  𝑘

k: 𝑘
k represents a position in an ordered list of elements, specifically the "smallest" elements when they’re arranged in ascending order.

k-th Smallest Element: If you sort all elements in ascending order, the 𝑘
k-th smallest element is the element that appears in the 𝑘
k-th position of this sorted list.

Example:

Given a list of numbers [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], and if 𝑘 = 3
k=3, the goal is to find the 3rd smallest element.
Sorting the list gives [3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20].
The 3rd smallest element is 7, as it’s the third item in the sorted list.
